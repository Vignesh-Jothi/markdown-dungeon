## üë©‚Äçüíª Contribution Guidelines

### 1. üìê Make Adequately Sized Changes

- Keep changes small
- Always add a gate for readers who choose a new option to avoid dead links

#### Examples of appropriate changes:

- Add sentences to an existing "page" (file) in the room.
- Add a new option to an existing choice point, linking to an existing "room" or "floor."
- Add a new option, create a new "page," and provide content for the new option.

### 2. ‚õ© Dungeon Structure

Structure should be `dungeon-name/floor-number/room-number`. Follow these guidelines:

- Dungeon name: alphanumeric with dashes separating words (e.g., **normal-dungeon-1**).
- Floor number: numeric without leading zeros.
- Room number: numeric or alphanumeric with dashes for sub-rooms.

### 3. üîó Use Relative Links

All links must be [relative links](https://www.coffeecup.com/help/articles/absolute-vs-relative-pathslinks/) for continued functionality.

### 4. üìè Line Lengths

Keep lines 120 characters or less for readability.

### 5. ü™ì Blank Lines Between Options

Insert blank lines between different options for visual separation.
